\cmsNoteHeader{AN-16-368} % This is over-written in the CMS environment: useful as preprint no. for export versions
% >> Title: please make sure that the non-TeX equivalent is in PDFTitle below
\title{Search for new physics with high-mass tau pairs with 2016 data}

% >> Authors
%Author is always "The CMS Collaboration" for PAS and papers, so author, etc, below will be ignored in those cases
%For multiple affiliations, create an address entry for the combination
%To mark authors as primary, use the \author* form
\input{authorlist}

% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.
\date{\today}

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
This analysis focuses on the search for an extra neutral gauge boson that decays to pairs of high-$p_{T}$ $\tau$ leptons. The analysis is performed using 35.9
fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Begin text %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% **DO NOT REMOVE THE BIBLIOGRAPHY** which is located before the appendix.
%% You can take the text between here and the bibiliography as an example which you should replace with the actual text of your document.
%% If you include other TeX files, be sure to use "\input{filename}" rather than "\input filename".
%% The latter works for you, but our parser looks for the braces and will break when uploading the document.
