The presence of neutrinos in $\tau$ decays causes imbalance of total momentum as they 
escape from the detector without producing any direct response. The magnitude of the 
negative vector sum of the visible transverse momentum is known as missing transverse 
energy, denoted $E^{miss}_{T}$ ~\cite{MET}.

Missing transverse energy is one of the most important observables for discriminating 
the signal events from background events which do not contain neutrinos, such as QCD 
multijet and DY$\to\mu\mu$/ee events. Thus, we require events with $E^{miss}_{T} >$ 
30 GeV in all channels.

Anomalous high-$E^{miss}_{T}$ events can be due to various phenomena. For example, in 
the ECAL, spurious deposits may appear due to particles striking sensors in the ECAL 
photodetectors, in the HCAL spurious energy can arise due to noise in the hybrid 
photodiode (HPD) and readout box (RBX) electronics~\cite{METFilters}. In order to identify and suppress 
such high-$E^{miss}_{T}$ events, the following POG recommended filters are applied to 
the analysis:
\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
 \caption{MET Filters.\label{tab:metFilter}}
 \begin{tabular}{|c|}
 \hline\hline
       primary vertex filter \\
       beam halo filter	\\
       HBHE noise filter \\
       HBHEiso noise filter	\\
       ECAL TP filter \\
       ee badSC noise filter \\
       badMuon filter\\
       badCharged hadron filter\\
 \hline
 \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

These filters are $\approx 99$\% efficient for both the signal and background MC samples.
